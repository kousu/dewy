# The Dewy Video Annotator

The [Internet Archive](https://archive.org) have put out a [call for help](https://blog.archive.org/2017/01/05/internet-archives-trump-archive-launches-today/) in "enhanc[ing] search and discovery by collaborating in experiments to apply artificial intelligence-driven facial recognition, voice identification, and other video content analysis approaches" in order to make tracing primary source material feasible.

Our immediate goal is to support (i.e. automate as much as possible) the hyperlinking of conversations to their speakers and topics, similar to what [GovTrack](https://www.govtrack.us/) and [OpenParliament](https://openparliament.ca/) do for the US and Canada already, but from television and radio, rather than formatted text, sources.
